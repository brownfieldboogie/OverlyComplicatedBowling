## To start
Requires docker. Open your terminal and navigate to the repo, and execute:
1. docker compose build
2. docker compose up
Then, open your browser and go to http://localhost:8080

## Todo
There's still some stuff I want to work on.

- implement unit of work
- implement generic repository
- use environment variables in docker
- fix https
- make multiplayer (introduce "match" as an object containing multiple games - one pr bowler)
- fix unhandled exceptions in web
